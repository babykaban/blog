Hello everyone,

Welcome to the very first blog post for Spellweaver Saga: Retrieving The Legendary Relic! 
I’m Paul, the developer behind this indie game, and I’m excited to share my journey with 
you as I work on bringing this project to life.

# Game Concept
The main concept of Spellweaver Saga revolves around the player's ability to manipulate 
magic elements and combine them into spells or perform actions. This mechanic is central 
to the entire gameplay experience. The story follows a young mage who embarks on a quest 
to find a powerful artifact to protect his village. This artifact was researched by his 
mentor, who mysteriously disappeared.

# Development Journey
This game is being developed on a custom engine written in C/C++. I chose to develop my 
own engine to deepen my understanding of programming. Although the engine is still a work 
in progress, I decided to proceed with creating a game to test its capabilities. After 
completing a prototype and evaluating the engine's abilities, I began designing and 
developing the game. There were many challenges along the way, especially since I was new 
to game and engine development.

# Challenges and Solutions
One of the most significant challenges was the overall development process. I was able to 
overcome many hurdles thanks to the guidance provided by the video series Handmade Hero by 
Casey Muratori and other internet sources. These resources have been invaluable in helping 
me understand game development on a deeper level.

# Prototype Features
The current prototype includes a basic map layout, a few quests, and the core mechanic of 
combining elements. This mechanic will be significantly improved in the next version of the 
game. Over the last few months, I have also been working on the game's editor, which is a 
crucial part of the development process. The editor currently has the capability to create 
custom asset files for the game.

# Next Steps
The next steps in the development process include finishing the editor and starting on the 
first levels and designs of the game. I am excited to continue this journey and share 
updates with you as the game progresses.

# Community and Feedback
You can find the game prototype on the [projects page](/projects/spellweaver_saga/) or watch 
a demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7211-m05OSI). I would love to hear your feedback 
and thoughts as I continue to develop Spellweaver Saga. Your input will be invaluable in 
shaping the final game.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates and insights into the 
development process of Spellweaver Saga: Retrieving The Legendary Relic.

Best,
Paul
